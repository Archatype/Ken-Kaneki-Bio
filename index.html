<p style="color:red; font-size:20"> <strong> Ken Kaneki </strong> <em> (Kaneki Ken) </em> is the protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re. </p> <br>

<p style="color:red; font-size:20"> Formerly, he was a human studying Japanese Literature at Kamii University and living a normal life. However, everything soon changed after he had Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou transplanted into him and became a One-Eyed Ghoul. After joining Anteiku as a part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a Ghoul and became known as <strong> Eyepatch </strong> <em> (Gantai) </em>. </p> <br>

<p style="color:red; font-size:20"> After being captured by Aogiri Tree, he was able to accept his ghoul side, forming a team with the goal of protecting the ones precious to him and "plucking out" people who threaten the place he belongs to. Because of his Kakuja's distinct appearance, the CCG gave him the nickname <strong> Centipede </strong> <em> (Mukade) </em>. </p> <br> 

<p style="color:red; font-size:20"> He is currently living under the identity of <strong> Haise Sasaki </strong> <em> (Sasaki Haise) </em>, as a First Class Ghoul Investigator, serving as the mentor of the CCG's Quinx Squad and a member of Team Mado. His memories are lost to him, yet he is slowly beginning to understand what his past self was like through those that knew Ken Kaneki, such as Hinami Fueguchi. </p>
